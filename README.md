Computational Intelligence Projects

## Evolutionary Algorithms
[SnailJumper](https://github.com/amirrezarajabi/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Evolutionary-Projects/SnailJumper) : use EA && NN to help the character to cross the obstacles Obstacles include flies and snail

## Fuzzy
[Edge-Detection](https://github.com/amirrezarajabi/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Fuzzy-Projects/Edge-Detection) : detect edge usie fuzzy logic (more info in [paper.pdf](https://github.com/amirrezarajabi/computational-intelligence/blob/main/Fuzzy-Projects/Edge-Detection/paper.pdf))

[Inverted_Pendulum](https://github.com/amirrezarajabi/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Fuzzy-Projects/Inverted_Pendulum): Use fuzzy logic to hold the pendulum high

## Neural Networks
[Fruit](https://github.com/amirrezarajabi/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Neural-Network-Projects/Fruit): use NN for fruit recognition
